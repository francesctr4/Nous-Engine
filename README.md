### **Installation**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### In order to download and execute the engine you have to [Download the Latest Release](https://github.com/francesctr4/Nous-Engine/releases) and extract the zip.
> It is recommended that you extract the zip on the parent folder of the disk, so that the path doesn't get too long. <br>
> (e.g. ```D:\Nous-Engine-v0.3```)
>
> In this case, the **executable path** will be as follows: <br>
> ```D:\Nous-Engine-v0.3\Nous-Engine.exe```

### **Known Bugs**

- engine is not taking into account submeshes right now.
- crash when uploading several instances of the same textured mesh.
- vulakn synchronization issues when uploading concurrent geometry in release config
- vulkan validation errors when rendering different geometry at the same time

### **Future Roadmap**

While the current version of the engine demonstrates satisfactory results, this is only the beginning. There is still a great deal of potential to unlock, both by expanding the engineâ€™s features and by diving deeper into areas where multithreading can shine even more:
From a Multithreading perspective, there are several advanced features that could be explored and implemented in the future. These include work-stealing, interruptible threads, lock-free concurrency algorithms, adding priority to jobs, job dependencies, and callback functions on job completion or failure.
On the Engine Programming side, there is a long list of modules and tools that could be added to make it more complete. These include support for scripting, physics, animation, audio, UI, shaders, particles, and AI systems. Some core engine tools could also be implemented, such as the inspector, hierarchy, scene graph, mouse picking, frustum culling, time management, and some enhancements to the resource manager and assets browser.
In terms of Graphics Programming, there is significant room to enhance the visual capabilities of the engine. Some basic improvements could include implementing forward and deferred shading models with Blinn-Phong lighting. For more advanced techniques, support for physically-based rendering (PBR) with image-based lighting (IBL) could be added, along with post-processing effects such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), environment mapping, relief mapping, multi-pass bloom, water effects and shadow mapping.
Both the engine and graphics programming features have strong potential to benefit from the multithreading capabilities of the engine. Expanding in these areas would not only enhance its functionality but also better showcase the power of the job system. The work done so far has provided a solid foundation and allowed to deeply understand the core principles of Multithreading and Vulkan within the context of a Game Engine architecture. Nous Engine will remain ongoing; a project that will continue to be developed and evolved over time as a part of the personal portfolio.
