### **Installation**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### In order to download and execute the engine you have to [Download the Latest Release](https://github.com/francesctr4/Nous-Engine/releases) and extract the zip.
> It is recommended that you extract the zip on the parent folder of the disk, so that the path doesn't get too long. <br>
> (e.g. ```D:\Nous-Engine-v0.3```)
>
> In this case, the **executable path** will be as follows: <br>
> ```D:\Nous-Engine-v0.3\Nous-Engine\Nous-Engine.exe```

### **Known Bugs**

- Submesh support is currently unimplemented; only a single mesh per entity is rendered.
- Crashes may occur when uploading multiple instances of the same textured mesh simultaneously.
- Vulkan synchronization issues are present when uploading geometry concurrently in **Release** configurations.
- Vulkan validation layer errors may appear when rendering different geometries concurrently.

---

### **Future Roadmap**

While the current version of *Nous Engine* delivers promising results, it remains a foundation for much broader possibilities. Future development will focus on both expanding engine capabilities and deepening multithreading optimizations.

#### Multithreading Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Job System include:

- Work-stealing mechanisms for better load balancing
- Interruptible and cooperative threads
- Lock-free concurrency algorithms
- Job prioritization
- Job dependencies and graph-based scheduling
- Callback support on job completion or failure

#### Engine Features

To evolve into a more complete engine, future modules and tools may include:

- Scripting system (e.g., Lua or C#)
- Physics engine integration
- Animation system
- Audio subsystem
- User Interface (UI) framework
- Particle system
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) modules
- Shader management and editor tools

Additionally, planned core tools include:

- Scene graph and hierarchy system
- Inspector and property editor
- Mouse picking and object selection
- Frustum culling
- Advanced time management
- Resource manager and asset browser enhancements

#### Graphics Features

Graphics rendering will continue to evolve with both foundational and advanced techniques:

- Forward and deferred rendering pipelines
- Blinn-Phong and Phong lighting models
- Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) with Image-Based Lighting (IBL)
- Post-processing effects:
  - Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
  - Environment and relief mapping
  - Shadow mapping
  - Multi-pass bloom and water effects

---

As development continues, both the engineâ€™s architecture and its multithreading capabilities will be refined and extended. *Nous Engine* remains an evolving project.
